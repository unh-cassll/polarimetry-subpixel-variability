**Codes used in preparation of data**

These live within _codes. My implementation of the Elfouhaily *et al.* [1997] model wavenumber directional spectrum is provided in the ElfouhailyEtAl1997 subdirectory.

**Data used to produce graphics**

These files live within _data. This folder is meant to be the smallest collection of example data which could be feasibly used for demonstration/testing purposes. The original raw datasets from which the spectra/statistics were produced are substantial in size (of order 300 TB).

**Graphics**

These images live within _outputs/manuscript_files. The figure_gen script in the root directory handles the printing of these to file, with user-set option to print as vector (.svg) or raster (.png) images.
